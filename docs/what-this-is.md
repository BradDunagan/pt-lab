# pt-lab

A small lab for evaluating **photo-realistic, not-necessarily-realtime rendering in the browser** using [three.js](https://threejs.org) and [three-gpu-pathtracer](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer). The goal is to understand quality, convergence speed, and the integration surface before building this capability into a larger web app.

The demo loads a glTF model (Khronos Damaged Helmet) under an HDR environment (Poly Haven "Royal Esplanade") and renders it with a progressive GPU path tracer. A Svelte 5 control panel exposes bounces, render scale, sample cap, and environment intensity, plus a fixed-size PNG export of the converged frame.

## How it works

`three-gpu-pathtracer` is a WebGL2 path tracer built on `three-mesh-bvh`:

1. When `setScene()` is called, it collects the scene's geometry, materials, textures, and lights, builds a **BVH acceleration structure**, and packs everything into GPU textures.
2. Each call to `renderSample()` runs one path-tracing pass in a full-screen fragment shader and **accumulates** it with previous passes. Image quality is a function of accumulated sample count — noise fades as samples grow.
3. Any camera/material/environment change resets accumulation to sample 0 (via `updateCamera()`, `updateMaterials()`, `updateEnvironment()`, or `reset()`).

This maps well onto "photo-realistic stills": let the tracer run for seconds-to-a-minute and export the converged frame.

## Project structure

An npm-workspaces monorepo: `packages/pt-lab` is the consumable library, `packages/demo` is an in-repo consumer that supplies the demo assets. The library is used the way `../rr` uses `../paneless-workspace/packages/paneless` — a path dependency exposing `./src/index.ts`, compiled from source by the consumer's Vite. See the root `README.md` for the consumption recipe.

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `packages/pt-lab/src/index.ts` | Public barrel — the module entry (`svelte`/`main`/`types` point here). Exports `PathTracerLab` + types, the components, and the persistence/bundled modules. |
| `packages/pt-lab/src/lib/pathtracer.ts` | **The reusable core.** Framework-agnostic class wrapping renderer, scene, controls, and `WebGLPathTracer`. Talks to the host only through public methods and callbacks (`onStatus`, `onObjectsChanged`). Also owns the Scene Editor model: object registry, room swapping, serialize/apply, `.glb` import. Asset URLs are configurable via `LabOptions`. |
| `packages/pt-lab/src/lib/PathTracerViewer.svelte` | Thin Svelte binding: mounts the class on a canvas, wires `ResizeObserver`, disposes on unmount. |
| `packages/pt-lab/src/lib/TransformPanel.svelte`, `MaterialPanel.svelte`, `BundleTree.svelte` | Inspector panels + the bundled-objects tree. |
| `packages/pt-lab/src/lib/scenes.ts`, `library-store.ts` | localStorage stores for named scenes and imported `.glb` objects. |
| `packages/pt-lab/src/lib/bundled.ts` + `src/assets/imports/` | Build-time enumeration of bundled importable objects (travels with the library). |
| `packages/demo/src/App.svelte` | Control panel + Scene Editor UI (Svelte 5 runes), importing everything from `'pt-lab'`. |
| `packages/demo/public/assets/` | Demo model + HDR + denoiser weights, served by the demo app. |

## Scenes

A Scene selector in the sidebar (backed by the `?scene=` query param; switching reloads the page) chooses the experiment:

| `?scene=` | Contents | Lighting |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | Damaged Helmet | HDR photo environment (Royal Esplanade) |
| `procedural` | clearcoat knot, chrome + glass spheres | HDR photo environment |
| `room` | 6×6×3 m room, table + red cube + gray ball | Room baked into a **generated** HDR env map; the light is a bright ceiling patch painted into it. Importance-sampled → converges fast, but direction-only: no parallax, and the light appears in the same direction from every point |
| `room-emissive` | same | Room as real geometry; the light is an **emissive mesh**. Physically correct falloff/parallax/occlusion, but very noisy — the path tracer does not importance-sample emissive meshes, so rays find the light only by chance |
| `room-arealight` | same | Room as real geometry; the light is a **`RectAreaLight`**, which the path tracer importance-samples → spatially correct *and* fast. Lights are invisible to rays in this pathtracer version, so the lamp's output is split 90/10 between the sampled light and a co-located emissive quad that makes the fixture visible |

The room trio is a deliberate ladder — baked environment vs. emissive geometry vs. sampled light — demonstrating why production scenes model nearby lights as sampled light objects and reserve the environment map for distant surroundings. In the room scenes the Environment slider scales the lamp instead of an env map. `window.__lab` exposes the `PathTracerLab` instance for console/automation driving.

## Scene Editor

The **Edit Scene / Return to Render** button toggles between two modes:

- **Render** — the path-traced Live Scene described above (plus AI denoising).
- **Edit** — a fast **raster** preview (`renderer.render(scene, camera)` each frame, no accumulation) for composing a scene. Edits show instantly; the traced BVH only rebuilds when you return to Render. Raster fidelity varies by room — reflections need a `scene.environment` or direct light, so the emissive room looks dark in Edit and is best judged in Render.

A scene is **data**, not code: a chosen room + which objects are included + each object's material and transform + the scene's lights + the camera. The editor sidebar (in Edit mode) is: a **Room** dropdown, an **Objects** list (checkbox = in the scene, name = select for editing), a **Lights** list, and an inspector group for the selected object or light.

### Editing objects — material properties

The material controls use artist-friendly names mapped onto the underlying `MeshPhysicalMaterial` (PBR):

| Control | Maps to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Color** | `material.color` | Base color / albedo — the light the surface doesn't absorb. |
| **Shininess** | `1 − roughness` | Reflection sharpness: high = mirror-crisp highlights, low = matte/blurred. |
| **Reflectivity** | `metalness` | Dielectric ↔ conductor: low = plastic (weak reflections + diffuse color), high = metal (mirror-like, reflections tinted by the color, no diffuse). |

The two sliders together span a wide range — shiny+reflective = chrome, shiny+non-reflective = polished plastic, matte+reflective = brushed metal, matte+non-reflective = chalk. **Transform** (Position m / Rotation ° / Scale) edits the object's placement.

Why edits behave differently: material changes are cheap (`updateMaterials()` keeps the BVH); moving/scaling geometry needs a BVH refit, so it applies live in raster and rebuilds via `setScene()` on return to Render.

### Lights

**Add light** (in the Lights group) adds a light to the scene; a scene can hold any number, alongside the room's own lighting. Select one to edit it in the **Light** inspector, and remove it with **×**:

| Control | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Display name in the Lights list. |
| **Type** | **Point** (`PointLight`, radiates in all directions), **Spot** (`SpotLight`, 45° cone with a soft edge), or **Area** (0.5 × 0.5 m `RectAreaLight`, one-sided). Spot and area lights aim at the room center (the floor origin). Changing type resets intensity to that type's default. |
| **Color** | Light color (sRGB). |
| **Intensity** | three.js physical units: candela for point/spot, nits for area. Defaults (20 cd, 80 nt) give roughly the room lamp's brightness straight below the light. |
| **Position** | World position in meters. |

Lights are invisible to camera rays in the path tracer, so in Edit mode each one is drawn as a small colored sphere. The spheres are rendered in a separate raster-only pass: they are never part of the path-traced scene, the BVH, or the ground-truth/depth exports. There is no light marker in Render mode.

Light edits don't need a BVH rebuild: `updateLights()` repacks the tracer's light list, immediately in Render mode or on return from Edit mode. Things to know:

- **Point lights have no size**, so their shadows are perfectly hard and they don't appear in mirror reflections. Use an Area light for soft shadows.
- **Each light added makes every light noisier.** Each sample picks one light at random, so the room lamp's soft shadows take longer to converge.
- **No directional (sun) light.** In the geometric rooms the walls and ceiling would block its infinitely distant source, so it would light the raster preview but not the path-traced render.
- **The Environment slider doesn't affect editor lights**; it still scales only the room lamp or the baked environment.

### Persistence

Scenes are named and saved to localStorage (**New** / **Save…** / **Delete**). A new scene is a room with its light and no objects. The render-mode Scene dropdown lists the built-in demos (which reload) plus saved scenes (which apply live, rebuilt from scratch by `applyScene` so loading works identically from any starting point). Two storage tiers: the **object library** (Table/Cube/Ball + imports) persists globally; each **scene** stores only per-object inclusion/material/transform keyed by object name, plus its lights (scenes saved before lights existed load with none).

### Importing Blender models

**Import .glb…** (in the Objects group) adds a model to the object library; it persists (bytes stored base64 in localStorage) and appears in every editor scene without re-importing. The **×** beside an imported object removes it. Imports are parsed once into a template and cloned per scene with independent materials, so editing one scene's copy doesn't affect others.

**Bundled objects**: a "Bundled objects" browser (in the Objects group) lists `.glb` files that ship with the app under `src/assets/imports/`, as a tree mirroring the folder layout. `src/lib/bundled.ts` enumerates them at build time with `import.meta.glob('../assets/imports/**/*.glb', { query: '?url', eager: true })` and assembles the flat result into a directory tree — drop a new file or subdirectory into `assets/imports/` and it appears automatically, no manifest to maintain. Clicking a file fetches its URL and runs it through the same `importGLB` as the file picker (so it joins the persistent library); files already in the library are marked and disabled.

Recommended Blender export: **File → Export → glTF 2.0**, format **glTF Binary (.glb)**. Use the **Principled BSDF** (its base color, roughness, metallic, transmission, IOR, and emission map to the material via KHR extensions). **Turn off Draco / mesh compression** — no decompressor is wired in. Apply object transforms (**Ctrl+A → All Transforms**) so the position/rotation/scale sliders behave predictably; the exporter's default **+Y up** is correct. Keep meshes simple and untextured — see Storage limits below.

### Storage limits ⚠️

Everything the editor persists lives in the browser's **localStorage**, which is small — roughly **5 MB per origin, shared across all of the app's storage**. Two tiers:

- **Saved scenes** (`pt-lab.scenes`) are lightweight — just references and numbers (room, per-object inclusion/material/transform, lights, camera).
- **Imported objects** (`pt-lab.library`) are the heavy tier: every import — from the file picker *or* the bundled browser — stores the `.glb` bytes as base64, which inflates the raw file size by ~33%.

So the real constraint is the number and size of imported objects. A handful of simple, untextured meshes (like the letter set) is fine; large or textured models, or many imports, can exhaust the quota. When a save would overflow, **the import is aborted** (nothing already stored is lost) and the app shows a **"Storage full — delete some scenes or objects"** message. Mitigations: keep imported meshes simple and untextured, and remove unused ones with the **×** in the Objects list. If a large *bundled* set ever becomes the bottleneck, the intended fix is to make bundled objects a **non-persisted tier** — loaded from the app's assets each session (they're always available at their URLs) rather than copied into localStorage on import.

## Integration notes for the larger web app

### Keep the renderer behind an abstraction

`src/lib/pathtracer.ts` is deliberately framework-agnostic — the Svelte layer is ~40 lines of glue. Two reasons to keep this boundary in the real app:

- **WebGPU is coming.** three.js's `WebGPURenderer`/TSL is the ecosystem's forward path, and WebGPU path tracers are emerging but not yet mature. Keeping the path tracer behind your own interface means you can swap the backend later without touching app code.
- **Version coupling.** `three-gpu-pathtracer` reaches into three.js internals (shaders, material properties). Pin your `three` version and re-test when upgrading. Current known-good pairing: `three@0.185` + `three-gpu-pathtracer@0.0.24` (which requires `three >= 0.180`).

### The hybrid rendering pattern

Production UX is **rasterize while interacting, path trace when idle**. `WebGLPathTracer` has this built in — the lab configures it like so:

```ts
pathTracer.rasterizeScene = true;   // draw a normal raster frame during the reset delay
pathTracer.renderDelay = 150;       // ms after a reset before path tracing resumes
pathTracer.dynamicLowRes = true;    // trace at low res first, then full res
pathTracer.fadeDuration = 300;      // fade the traced image in over the raster one
pathTracer.tiles.set(2, 2);         // render in tiles to keep the main thread responsive
```

The render loop then just calls `renderSample()` every frame and `updateCamera()` on camera change; the library handles the raster/trace crossfade. Tiling matters at full resolution — a single untiled sample on a large canvas can blow a frame budget and make the tab feel frozen.

### Scene updates are expensive

`setScene()` rebuilds the BVH and repacks all textures. That's fine for "configure scene → render", but not per-frame. In an app where users edit the scene:

- Material/uniform-level changes are cheap: `updateMaterials()` / `updateEnvironment()` keep the BVH.
- Geometry/topology changes require a rebuild. For large scenes, do it off the main thread: `pathTracer.setBVHWorker(new ParallelMeshBVHWorker())` (from `three-mesh-bvh/worker`) + `setSceneAsync()`. The lab uses the synchronous path because the helmet builds in well under a second.

### Convergence and denoising

Progressive accumulation means clean output takes hundreds of samples. Practical levers:

- **Sample cap + UI feedback**: expose `pathTracer.samples` (the lab shows samples + elapsed time). Users tolerate waiting when they can see progress.
- **`filterGlossyFactor`** (~0.5): blurs caustic-ish glossy paths slightly to kill fireflies at a small quality cost.
- **`renderScale`**: converge at 0.5× for previews, 1× for finals.
- **AI denoising**: the "AI denoise" checkbox runs [oidn-web](https://github.com/pissang/oidn-web) (Intel Open Image Denoise via tfjs/WebGPU — WebGPU-only). Implementation: the tone-mapped canvas is captured and denoised on a doubling schedule (4, 8, 16, … samples, plus a final pass at the sample cap), with the result drawn to a 2D overlay canvas that fades in over the live render; any accumulation reset hides it. `oidn-web` is dynamically imported on first enable (it pulls in tfjs); weights live in `public/assets/` (`rt_ldr.tza`, `rt_ldr_alb_nrm.tza` — Git LFS files in their source repos, fetch via the LFS media endpoint or batch API, not `raw.githubusercontent.com`).

### Fixed-size PNG export

**Save PNG** exports at a chosen square resolution (64²–1024², from the Export size dropdown), independent of the viewport/display. `exportPNG()` temporarily resizes the renderer to `size × size` at pixel-ratio 1 with a square camera, converges to a fixed sample count (the render loop yields to it so the button can show progress), captures, and restores the interactive view. It's a genuine native-resolution render, not a resample. Two gotchas it handles: the WebGL drawing buffer isn't preserved across composites, so the final sample is drawn and captured in the **same synchronous tick** (an intervening animation frame blanks it); and all renderer/camera state is saved and restored around the export.

If AI denoise is on, the export is denoised too: it snapshots the color `ImageData` (plus albedo/normal aux buffers at the render resolution when aux is enabled), `await`s the UNet to load, runs it, and writes the denoised result. Convergence maps to 0–85% of the progress bar and denoising to 85–100%. It falls back to a raw export (with a console warning) if WebGPU is missing or aux capture fails.

Two size subtleties in the denoise path: OIDN pads any input smaller than its tile size (256 for these weights) and the garbage padding bleeds into the image through the UNet's receptive field — wrecking small denoised exports. So when denoising, the scene is rendered and denoised at `max(size, 256)` and then downscaled to the requested size (`DENOISE_MIN_SIZE`). And the aux buffers must be captured with the tile scissor test disabled, or the path tracer's leftover tile clip leaves parts of them at the clear color.
- **Auxiliary buffers** ("Albedo/normal aux" checkbox, on by default): alongside the noisy color, the denoiser receives two noise-free guide images rendered from the scene — a per-mesh unlit base-color pass (albedo; materials temporarily swapped for `MeshBasicMaterial` mirrors, background white per OIDN convention) and a packed view-space normal pass (`scene.overrideMaterial = MeshNormalMaterial`, background 0x808080 = zero normal). These act as an edge map, so low-sample denoised images keep silhouettes and material boundaries crisp instead of smearing them. Captured once per accumulation cycle into `WebGLRenderTarget`s (albedo target uses an sRGB texture so readback matches the color capture; rows are flipped since GL reads bottom-up), cached until the next reset. Aux and color-only UNets are incompatible, so both are kept and lazily loaded; if aux weights or capture fail, it falls back to color-only with a console warning. Known simplifications: normal maps are lost under the override material, and emissive-only surfaces (the room lamp) get black albedo. Denoising tone-mapped LDR remains off-spec (OIDN prefers linear HDR) but works well in practice.

### Color-space tagging

`canvas.toBlob()` writes an untagged PNG — IHDR/IDAT/IEND and nothing else, no color chunks at all — which leaves every reader to guess the transfer function. The beauty exports are ACES tone-mapped and sRGB-encoded (the renderer's default `outputColorSpace`), so they say so: `tagSRGB()` splices an **sRGB** chunk plus the **gAMA** (45455) and **cHRM** (sRGB primaries, D65) pair the spec wants written alongside it into the blob after IHDR, CRCs and all. It skips chunks the encoder already wrote and stands down entirely if an `iCCP` or `cICP` is present, so it's idempotent and never fights a color-managed file.

The dataset passes below are deliberately left **untagged**: they hold raw linear code values (packed depth, normalized positions), not color, and a color tag would invite a decoder to convert them. Load them with `NoColorSpace` in three.js — the `Texture` default, so a plain `TextureLoader` is already correct — and never set `SRGBColorSpace` on them.

### Dataset exports (G-buffer ground truth for world-lab)

Beyond the beauty PNG, the demo can export ground-truth passes for grading vision experiments in
`../world-lab-workspace` — these are raster-only override-material passes (instant, never path
traced), following the same capture pattern as the denoiser's aux buffers:

- **Rotation-series export** (`exportRotationSeries`): rotates a selected object through an angle
  range and saves a path-traced beauty + an **object-space-position** pass per angle
  (`<base>-ryNNN.png` / `-pos.png`). The position pass encodes each fragment's local vertex position
  normalized to the object bbox — the same surface point keeps the same RGB under any rotation — so
  it's a correspondence oracle for grading feature matchers (world-lab Demo 8). The matcher itself
  must only ever see the RGB frames.
- **Depth-pass export** (`exportDepthPass`): saves the current view's **forward depth** (camera-space
  −z, the convention world-lab's plane sweep uses) for the whole scene, packed 24-bit into RGB with
  the standard fract ladder (alpha = coverage), max depth in the filename:
  `<base>-x<X>-y<Y>-z<Z>-depth<max>.png` (decode `depth = (R/255 + G/65025 + B/16581375) × max`).
  Position-in-filename matches the multi-view convention Demos 6/7 parse, so a depth pass pairs
  automatically with a beauty export of the same view and grades Demo 7's dense reconstruction.

- **AOV set** (`exportAOVs`): saves depth, normal and albedo for the current view in one call —
  `<base>-depth.png`, `-normal.png`, `-albedo.png` — and **returns** `maxDepth` alongside the file
  names rather than only baking it into one, because parsing a float back out of a filename is a
  thing that breaks. Same passes, same encodings and same untagged policy as the two above; the
  normal and albedo captures are the denoiser's own aux buffers, reused. The set decomposes *why*
  an edge is in a picture: a depth step is an occlusion, a normal step with no depth step is a
  crease, an albedo step with neither is texture, and an edge with none of the three belongs to the
  lighting rather than to the object.
- **Projected geometry** (`groundTruthGeometry`): returns — as plain data, never three.js objects —
  every mesh edge that is a **silhouette**, a **crease** or a mesh **boundary**, projected into
  image space, with the fraction of it that is actually visible measured against the depth pass,
  plus the vertices those edges meet at. This is the pass that answers "is the corner a detector
  reported a real one", which no raster pass can: a corner is a *point*, and extracting points from
  an edge image is itself the problem under test.

  Three limits are worth stating rather than discovering. A **geometric edge need not be a visible
  one** — two faces meeting under flat lighting produce no gradient. A **visible edge need not be
  geometric** — shadow boundaries and specular terminators are real image edges and are not here.
  And **visibility is rasterised**, so it is right to about a pixel; `gtVisibleAt` documents the
  tolerance and the measurement behind it. `creaseAngle` matters: at 1° a smooth sphere yields every
  one of its facet boundaries, at 20° it correctly yields none and keeps only its silhouette.

  Edges are keyed by position across the whole scene rather than per mesh, so a floor and the wall
  standing on it share the entry their common edge sits at and the dihedral between them comes out
  as the 90° it really is.

In dev builds the demo exposes `window.__ptlab` (the `PathTracerLab` instance) so browser automation
and console experiments can drive the camera and exports directly — the camera panel's live inputs
re-render from rAF-driven state, which hidden tabs pause.

### Other production caveats

- **Material coverage**: `MeshPhysicalMaterial` is the well-supported path (transmission, clearcoat, sheen, iridescence). Custom `ShaderMaterial`s won't translate — the path tracer has its own material model.
- **Bundle size**: three + pathtracer is ~875 kB minified (~233 kB gzip). In the larger app, lazy-load the whole rendering module (`import('./pathtracer')`) so it doesn't sit in the critical path.
- **Mobile / weak GPUs**: fragment-shader path tracing is heavy and some mobile GPUs hit precision/timeout issues. Feature-detect WebGL2 float-texture support and consider gating the feature or defaulting to raster on mobile.
- **Context loss**: long GPU-heavy sessions can lose the WebGL context (especially when tabbed away). Listen for `webglcontextlost`/`webglcontextrestored` on the canvas and rebuild.
- **Maintenance status**: `three-gpu-pathtracer` is stable and widely used, but development has slowed (0.0.24, Feb 2026). Treat it as a mature-but-quiet dependency: pin versions, keep the abstraction boundary, and watch the WebGPU ecosystem as the eventual successor.

## Running

```sh
npm install      # once, at the workspace root
npm run dev      # demo dev server (packages/demo)
npm run check    # type-check both packages (build does not type-check)
npm run build    # build the demo app
```

Orbit with the mouse; release and the image starts converging. **Save PNG** re-renders the scene at a chosen square resolution (64²–1024²) and downloads it.
